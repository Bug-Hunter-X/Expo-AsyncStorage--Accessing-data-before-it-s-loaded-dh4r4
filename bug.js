This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and you try to access the stored data before it's fully loaded.  This often happens when a component mounts and immediately tries to read from AsyncStorage within its `useEffect` hook without providing a delay or check. This leads to a null or undefined value being accessed, which may throw an error or cause unexpected behavior.  A similar issue can happen with other asynchronous operations in Expo.
